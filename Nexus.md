```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Iziedking/nexus-node-guide/main/install.sh)
```
### Create a screen
```bas
screen -S nexus
```
### start node with node ID
```bash
nexus-network start --node-id your-node-id
```
### How to get node ID
#### From Nexus web App
i. Goto [Node region](https://app.nexus.xyz/nodes)
ii. Click on ``Add Node`` then ``Add CLI Node`` then copy ``node-id`` (replace ``your-node-id`` with ``node-id`` you copied)
#### From CLI direct
i. Register your wallet first (copy from Nexus dashboard)
```bash
source ~/.bashrc

nexus-network register-user --wallet-address your-wallet-address
```
ii. Replace ``your-wallet-address`` with address you copied

iii. Create node ID
```bash
nexus-network register-node
```
iv. Then go to dashboard copy ID and replace with ``your-node-id``

## 5. If you are using ubuntu 22.0 or below you might face errors like 
**Error: nexus-network: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.39' not found (required by nexus-network)**
to fix that run this script

2. open multiple screen for each
3. if you did not face any GLIBC-limited error thrn run
```bash
nexus-network start --node-id your-node-id
```
4. Run on each screen you open to start node
   
5. If you faced GLIBC-limited error then run
```bash
./start --node-id <your-node-id>
```
6. Run this on each screen you create
